      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Destroy all Klingon warships within the specified number of Star Dates.</p>
      <p>
        The mission will end if:
        <ul>
          <li>The Enterprise destroys all Klingon warships</li>
          <li>The Enterprise is destroyed by a Klingon warship</li>
          <li>The Enterprise runs out of energy</li>
          <li>The Enterprise runs out of time</li>
        </ul>
        When the mission has ended, a new one be started by clicking the 'New Game' link.
      </p>
      <p>A number of Star Bases are location throughout the galaxy. Docking with a Star Base replenishes the Enterprise's energy and photon torpedoes, and also repairs all damage. The Enterprise can dock with a Star Base by positioning itself in an adjacent sector.</p>
      <p>Parts of the Enterprise will fail spontaneously. As you navigate around they will slowly get repaired.</p>
      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>nav {direction: number} {distance: number}</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Moves the Enterprise for a given distance in the specified direction.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Direction </strong>is expressed as a number between 1.0 and 9.0, using a polar coordinate system.

          </p>
          <p><strong>Distance</strong> is specified as a number between 0.1 and the current maximum warp factor. To navigate within the current quadrant, specify a distance < 1.</p>
          <p>
            This command will fail if:
            <ul>
              <li>the direction specified is invalid</li>
              <li>the distance specified is invalid</li>
              <li>the distance specified exceeds the current maximum warp factor</li>
              <li>insufficient energy is available to move the specified distance</li>
              <li>an obstacle is blocking the way</li>

          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>she {add|sub} {amount: number}</dt>
        <dd>
          Add or subtract energy from the shields. This command will fail if:
          <ul>
            <li>the shield controls have sustained damage</li>
            <li>the amount specified is less than zero</li>
            <li>the amount specified is greater than the ship's available energy</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>pha {energy: number}</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Fire phasers using the specified amount of energy. Phasers will automatically target each Klingon warship in the current quadrant. Phasers are more effective at close range.</p>
          <p>This command will fail if:
            <ul>
              <li>the phaser controls have sustained damage</li>
              <li>the amount specified is less than zero</li>
              <li>there are no Klingon ships in the current quadrant</li>

          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>pho {direction: number}</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Fire a photon torpedo in the specified direction.</p>
          <p><strong>Direction </strong>is expressed as a number between 1.0 and 9.0, using the polar coordinate system described above.</p>
          <p>
            This command will fail if:
            <ul>
              <li>the photon torpedo controls have sustained damage</li>
              <li>photon torpedos have been exhausted</li>
              <li>there are no Klingon ships in the current quadrant</li>
              <li>the direction specified is invalid</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>If a photon torpedo enters a sector which contains a Star, it will be captured by the star's gravitational pull and not reach its intended target.</p>
          <p>If a photon torpedo enters a sector which contains a Star Base, the Star Base will be destroyed and the photon torpedo will not reach its intended target.</p>
          <p>If there are Klingons in the current quadrant, a photon torpedo command can be generated by <u>clicking on a sector containing a Klingon warship</u>.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>nav calc {column: number} {row: number}</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Calculate the command required to navigate to the specifed quadrant. If the quadrant is valid, the navigation command will be automatically inputted into the command input console.
          </p>
          <p>Both <strong>Column</strong> and <strong>Row</strong> are expressed as a whole number between 1 and 8.</p>
          <p>
            This command will fail if:
            <ul>
              <li>the navigation computer has sustained damage</li>
              <li>either the quadrant column or row specified is not a whole number between 1 and 8</li>
              <li>the quadrant specified is the current location of the Enterprise</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Alternatively, a navigation command can be calculated by <u>selecting a location on either the Short-Range or Long-Range Scanner</u>.</p>
